# Java Programming Exercises: Early Projects from 2011

This repository showcases a collection of 49 Java exercises and an additional project, **Car Factory**, developed to solidify Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. These projects were part of my early programming journey in 2011 and demonstrate a wide range of skills, including basic programming concepts, data structures, and OOP principles.

## Car Factory

The **Car Factory** project demonstrates practical use of Object-Oriented Programming principles to simulate a car manufacturing and sales process.

### Features

1. **Assemble Cars** - Input car models and colors to assemble new cars.
2. **Sell Cars** - Sell cars from the inventory.
3. **View Inventory** - Displays all cars currently in stock.
4. **Interactive Menu** - User-friendly interface for managing operations.

### Project Structure

- `Car` Class: Represents car attributes like model and color.
- `Factory` Class: Manages the car inventory.
- `Menu` Class: Handles user interactions.
- `Main` Class: Entry point for the program.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meierrene/java-programming-exercises.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a Project Directory: Each exercise and project is in its own directory. For example**:
   ```bash
   cd exercise49-searchtree
   ```
3. **Compile and Run: Use javac to compile and java to run the program. Example**:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```
